#  Emotion Detection Using Facial Features

This project detects human emotions from facial images using a custom DFS-based algorithm and manual facial feature extraction. It's designed for lightweight image-based emotion classification without using deep learning models.

## üîç Features
- Detects emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, etc.
- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection and image processing
- Implements a **DFS-style logic** to analyze facial landmarks manually
- Works with static images

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- DFS-based logic (custom algorithm)
